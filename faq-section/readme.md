### Accordion FAQ Section Challenge

#### **Objective**
Your task is to create a collapsible FAQ section where each question can expand or collapse to reveal its corresponding answer. Use **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript** to build this interactive component.

---

#### **Requirements**
1. **HTML**: Structure the FAQ section with semantic elements. Each FAQ should have:
   - A question (clickable button).
   - A hidden answer section that becomes visible when the question is clicked.

2. **CSS**: Use **Tailwind CSS** to style the FAQ section:
   - Make it visually appealing with spacing, borders, and hover effects.
   - Add smooth animations when expanding or collapsing answers (e.g., `transition` utilities).

3. **JavaScript**: Implement the functionality:
   - Clicking a question toggles the visibility of its answer.
   - If an answer is already visible, clicking it again should hide it.
   - Ensure only **one answer is expanded at a time** (optional for advanced functionality).

#### **Steps to Complete**
1. **HTML**:
   - Use the provided scaffold to structure your FAQ items.
   - Add meaningful content for each question and answer.

2. **CSS**:
   - Customize the appearance using Tailwind's utility classes (e.g., colors, spacing, and shadows).
   - Add transitions to enhance the expand/collapse effect.

3. **JavaScript**:
   - Select all FAQ questions using `querySelectorAll`.
   - Write an event listener to toggle the visibility of the corresponding answer.
   - (Optional) Ensure other answers collapse when a new question is expanded.

---

#### **Bonus Challenges**
- Add an icon (e.g., a plus or minus) that changes when the answer is expanded or collapsed.
- Implement keyboard accessibility (e.g., toggle with Enter key).
- Ensure responsiveness for different screen sizes.

---

#### **Expected Outcome**
A fully functional and styled FAQ section that meets the requirements and provides a smooth user experience.

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
